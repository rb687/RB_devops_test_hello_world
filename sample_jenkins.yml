      #We will approach the blue-green deployment method to avoid any downtime
        # 1. Determine the current 'live' environment. Lets call it Green env.
        # 2. Deploy the dependencies, create any new services needed etc and the code to the 'non-live' environment. Lets call it blue env.
        # 3. Once deployment is finished, do functional tests. Ideally, it should be done using automated scripts using pkgs like selenium.
        #    OR do a manual functional testing if the selenium tests are not available(depending on the situation). If doing a manual
        #    check, we need a 'stop for input' check ie. deployment process stops until someone goes and click a proceed button. SRE would come in the picture here.
        # 4. If all tests passes (assuming going via selenium test route), switch the live DNS to the 'non-live' env in-turn,
        #    turning the earlier 'live' env to 'non-live' ie. now the blue env takes traffic. And also point the non-live DNS to green env ie. the green env
        #    is now your 'non-live' env and the DR/non-live URLs point to green env.
        #    If any test fails for any reason, rollback to the previous version and break. Send notification/create a high severity incident ticket for investigation.
        # 5. Deploy the dependencies on Green env since now its non-live.
        # 6. Once deployment is finished, perform the selenium tests again.
        # 7. Once successful, send notification. Leave the live DNS pointed to the blue env as this helps check the site reliability as well.
        # 8. Note:
        #     a. If there are multi regional deployments, we will need to finish Step 1-4 for all regions before proceeding to Step 5.
        #     b. If there are monitoring for both PROD and DR (which there should be), depending on lower env testing of how long the deployment takes
        #         we might also need to turn the monitoring alerts off temporarily for the environment where deployment is going on
        #         to avoid any false positive incidents being created for a down env while deployment is in progress.
